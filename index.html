<h1>I don't know what to say
I guess you got impatient
I hear you saying words
But my heart can't fuckin' take it
I never left you, babe
I thought for sure we'd make it
But you walked away without any hesitation
I waited for ya, you never came
I gave you my all, thought you'd do the same
I won't believe it, this can't be the end</h1>
